Here's how the function works:

It creates a shallow copy of the obj object using the spread operator ({...obj}) and assigns it to the preFormatted constant.

The function iterates over the properties of the obj object using Object.keys(obj).forEach().

For each property, it checks if the object has a property named extractMultiples using the hasOwnProperty method.

If obj[property] has the extractMultiples property, the function iterates over the inner properties of obj[property] using Object.keys(obj[property]).forEach().

If an inner property is equal to extractMultiples, it assigns the value of obj[property][innerProp] to obj[property][property]. This effectively renames the property to match the outer property name, essentially "flattening" the nested structure.

After the inner iteration, the function creates an empty object called flattened.

It iterates over the properties of obj using Object.keys(obj).forEach().

For each property, it checks if the value is an object (excluding null) and not an array using typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && !Array.isArray(value).

If the value is an object, the flattenObject function is recursively called on the value using Object.assign(flattened, flattenObject(value)).

If the value is not an object, it assigns the value directly to the corresponding property in the flattened object.

It assigns the preFormatted object to the preFormatted property of the flattened object.

It deletes the property with the name extractMultiples from the flattened object using delete flattened[extractMultiples].

Finally, the flattened object is returned as the output of the flattenObject function.

In summary, the flattenObject function takes an object and "flattens" its nested structure by renaming properties that match the extractMultiples string to their respective outer property names. It recursively traverses nested objects and assigns all properties to a new object called flattened. The function also preserves the original object as preFormatted and deletes the property named extractMultiples from the flattened object before returning it.
