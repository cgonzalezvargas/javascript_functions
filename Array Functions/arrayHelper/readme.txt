Here's how the function works:

It initializes an empty array called result to store the chunks of the input array.

The function enters a while loop, which continues as long as the arr parameter has elements (i.e., its length is greater than 0).

Inside the loop, the function uses the splice method to extract a chunk from the beginning of the arr array. The splice method modifies the original array by removing the extracted elements and returns an array containing those elements. The 0 as the first argument indicates the starting index for extraction, and size as the second argument determines the number of elements to extract.

The extracted chunk is then pushed (added) to the result array using the push method. This creates a new array of chunks.

Steps 3 and 4 repeat until all elements of the arr array have been processed and extracted into chunks. Once the arr array is empty, the loop terminates.

Finally, the result array, containing the chunks of the original array, is returned as the output of the chunk function.

In summary, the chunk function takes an array and a size as input and splits the array into smaller chunks of the specified size. The function iterates over the input array, removing elements in batches of size and storing them in a new array. The function continues this process until all elements of the input array have been processed and split into chunks. The resulting array of chunks is then returned by the function.
