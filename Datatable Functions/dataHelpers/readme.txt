Here's how the function works:

It extracts the propertyName and type properties from the property object using destructuring assignment.

The function uses a switch statement to handle different types of properties.

For each case, a specific sorting operation is performed on the list array using the sort method.

Case 'text':

The sorting is based on the values of the propertyName property in each object of the list array.
The values are converted to lowercase using the toLowerCase method to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
The comparison is done using the ternary operator.
If direction is "asc", the objects are sorted in ascending order (a > b ? 1 : -1).
If direction is "desc", the objects are sorted in descending order (b > a ? 1 : -1).
Case 'caseSensitive':

The sorting is similar to the 'text' case but without converting the values to lowercase.
The ternary operator is used to perform the comparison.
If direction is "asc", the objects are sorted in ascending order (a[propertyName] > b[propertyName] ? 1 : -1).
If direction is "desc", the objects are sorted in descending order (b[propertyName] > a[propertyName] ? 1 : -1).
Case 'date' and 'date-local':

The sorting is based on the values of the propertyName property, assuming they represent dates.
The values are parsed using Date.parse to convert them into timestamps.
The comparison is done by subtracting one timestamp from another.
If direction is "asc", the objects are sorted in ascending order (a - b).
If direction is "desc", the objects are sorted in descending order (b - a).
Case 'number':

The sorting is similar to the 'date' case but assumes the values of the propertyName property are numbers.
The values are parsed using parseFloat to convert them into numeric values.
The comparison is done by subtracting one number from another.
If direction is "asc", the objects are sorted in ascending order (a - b).
If direction is "desc", the objects are sorted in descending order (b - a).
Case 'groupByType':

This case is currently empty and has a TODO comment. It suggests that a specific sorting mechanism for grouping types should be implemented.
The function returns the sorted list array as the output, based on the specified property and sorting direction.

In summary, the sortFlatList function sorts an array of objects based on a specified property and sorting direction. It supports different types of properties such as text (case-insensitive), case-sensitive text, date, and number. The sorting behavior varies depending on the property type and direction.
